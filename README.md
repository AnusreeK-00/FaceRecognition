# FaceRecognition
Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.  This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!<br>
<h4>Steps:</h4> <br>
pip install cmake<br>
pip install face_recognition<br>
pip install numpy<br>
pip install dlib<br>
pip install opencv-python<br><br>

Create a folder called known_people (make sure this is in the same directory as recognize_face.py).<br>
Now we can add pictures of people we wish to identify by saving an image of their face in the known_people folder. Make sure the person is facing forwards and is the only person in the photograph (crop if necessary). We name each file as the personâ€™s name, as we wish it to appear on screen. In this case, only the .jpg files will be used.<br>

<h4> To run the program:</h4>
Run the recognize_face.py file in the terminal or cmd using appropriate commands.
